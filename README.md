# Code Complexity Project (Y03)

## Developed a tool to measure the complexity of Java/C++ code by analyzing each code statement.
    
    
### What the abbreviations in this program means:
* Cs	-> Complexity of a program statement due to size
* Ctc 	-> Complexity of a program statement due to type of control structures
* Cnc	-> Complexity of a program statement due to nesting of control structures
* Ci 	-> Complexity of a program statement due to inheritance
* TW	-> Total Weight
* Cps	-> Complexity of a program statement
* Cr	-> Complexity introduced due to recursion
* Cp	-> Complexity of a program
